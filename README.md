*Beta release(s) for next version of [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-syntax) theme for [Atom](http://atom.io).*

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress, and I still have quite a lot of updates to make before publishing any of this back into the main Seti release. Any feedback, suggestions, bug reports or contributions are welcome. Feel free to use with the understanding that it's an evolving code base with constant updates that could break things.
